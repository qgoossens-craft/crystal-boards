# Crystal Boards Plugin Development Progress

## Session Date: 2025-08-23

### Project Overview
Crystal Boards is a Kanban board plugin for Obsidian that provides project management capabilities with boards, columns, and cards.

## Major Bug Fixes and Features Implemented

### 1. Board Reordering System Fix
**Problem**: Board drag-and-drop reordering was broken, then arrow-based reordering was erratic
**Solution**: 
- Changed from up/down arrows to left/right arrows (← →)
- Fixed data corruption caused by wrong sorting in `getBoards()` method
- Changed from sorting by `modified` timestamp to sorting by `position`
- Added `fixBoardPositions()` method to auto-repair corrupted data on startup
- Fixed `moveDownBtn` undefined error by renaming to `moveRightBtn`

**Files Modified**:
- `data-manager.ts`: Renamed `moveBoardUp/Down` to `moveBoardLeft/Right`, fixed `getBoards()` sorting
- `dashboard-view.ts`: Updated UI to use left/right arrows and correct method calls
- `main.ts`: Added auto-repair call on plugin load

### 2. Dashboard Improvements
**Features Added**:
- Auto-refresh dashboard when returning to it (`onShow()` method)
- Removed column count from board stats (now shows only card count)
- Fixed arrow button hover styling with accent color

**Files Modified**:
- `dashboard-view.ts`: Added `onShow()` method, updated stats display
- `styles.css`: Enhanced button hover effects

### 3. Advanced Note Features
**Features Added**:
- Preview on hover for linked notes in cards
- Beautiful markdown rendering in previews
- Notes open in right pane when clicked
- Enter key support for todos in card modal
- Cover image display above board columns

**Implementation Details**:
- Created reusable `createNoteHoverPreview()` method
- Used `MarkdownRenderer.renderMarkdown()` for authentic Obsidian styling
- Hover previews work in both board view and card modal

**Files Modified**:
- `board-view.ts`: Added note preview functionality, cover image display
- `card-modal.ts`: Added identical hover preview support
- `styles.css`: Comprehensive preview styling

### 4. Cover Image Position Adjustment
**Problem**: Users needed ability to adjust cover image vertical position
**Solution**: 
- Added `coverImagePosition` field (0-100) to Board type
- Created dedicated `CoverImageEditorModal` accessible from board view
- Implemented live preview with real-time updates
- Added quick position presets (Top, Upper, Center, Lower, Bottom)

**Features**:
- "✏️ Adjust Image" button appears on hover over cover image
- Modal shows live preview window
- Slider control with dynamic tooltip (0-100%)
- Changes apply to both preview and actual cover in real-time
- Cancel reverts changes, Save persists them

**Files Modified**:
- `types.ts`: Added `coverImagePosition?: number` field
- `board-view.ts`: Added `openCoverImageEditor()` method and `CoverImageEditorModal` class
- `dashboard-view.ts`: Updated to apply position in board cards
- `styles.css`: Added modal and button styling

## Technical Patterns Used
- TypeScript with strict typing
- Obsidian Plugin API extensively
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Event listener management with cleanup
- Markdown rendering with `MarkdownRenderer.renderMarkdown()`
- File system operations with Obsidian's vault API
- Modal lifecycle management
- Hover preview with timeouts
- Split pane navigation

## Data Structure Enhancements
```typescript
interface Board {
  // ... existing fields
  coverImagePosition?: number; // 0-100, vertical position percentage
}
```

## Key Methods Added/Modified
- `moveBoardLeft()` / `moveBoardRight()` - Replaced up/down movement
- `fixBoardPositions()` - Auto-repairs corrupted position data
- `createNoteHoverPreview()` - Reusable hover preview functionality
- `openCoverImageEditor()` - Opens position adjustment modal
- `CoverImageEditorModal` - Full modal class for live position editing

## CSS Classes Added
- `.crystal-board-cover-edit-btn` - Hover button for cover editing
- `.crystal-cover-editor-modal` - Modal container
- `.crystal-cover-preview-container` - Preview window container
- `.crystal-cover-preview` - Preview image display
- `.crystal-position-presets` - Quick position buttons container
- `.crystal-preset-btn` - Individual preset buttons

## Current State
All requested features have been successfully implemented and tested. The plugin now has:
- Working board reordering with left/right arrows
- Auto-refreshing dashboard
- Beautiful markdown note previews on hover
- Cover image position adjustment with live preview
- Fixed all data corruption issues

## Next Potential Enhancements
