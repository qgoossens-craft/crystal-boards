# Crystal Boards - Bulk Selection Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive bulk selection system for cards in the Crystal Boards Obsidian plugin, allowing users to select multiple cards and perform bulk operations (delete, move to column, manage tags).

## Key Files Modified

### 1. board-view.ts
- Added selection state management properties to BoardView class:
  - `selectedCards: Set<string> = new Set()`
  - `bulkActionMode: boolean = false`

- Implemented selection management methods:
  - `toggleCardSelection(cardId: string)`: Toggle individual card selection
  - `selectAllCards()`: Select all cards across all columns
  - `clearSelection()`: Clear all selections
  - `updateCardSelectionUI(cardId: string)`: Update visual selection state
  - `updateBulkActionToolbar()`: Show/hide toolbar based on selection

- Added bulk action methods:
  - `async confirmBulkDelete()`: Show delete confirmation modal
  - `async executeBulkDelete()`: Delete selected cards
  - `openBulkMoveModal()`: Show column selection modal
  - `async executeBulkMove(targetColumnId: string)`: Move cards to target column
  - `openBulkTagModal()`: Show tag management modal
  - `async executeBulkTagAction(action: 'add' | 'remove' | 'replace', tags: string[])`: Manage tags on selected cards

- Modified `renderCard()` method to include checkbox element in card rendering

- Added three modal classes at end of file:
  - `BulkDeleteModal`: Confirmation dialog for bulk delete
  - `BulkMoveModal`: Column selection for bulk move
  - `BulkTagModal`: Tag management with add/remove/replace options

### 2. styles.css
Added comprehensive CSS for bulk selection UI:

```css
/* Card Selection Styles */
.crystal-card-selection {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0.4rem;
    left: 0.4rem;
    z-index: 10;
}

.crystal-card-checkbox {
    -webkit-appearance: none;
    -moz-appearance: none;
    appearance: none;
    width: 14px;
    height: 14px;
    border: 1px solid var(--background-modifier-border);
    border-radius: 2px;
    background: var(--background-primary);
    cursor: pointer;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    position: relative;
    transition: all 0.2s ease;
    outline: none;
}

.crystal-card-checkbox:checked {
    background: var(--interactive-accent);
    border-color: var(--interactive-accent);
}

.crystal-card-content {
    padding-left: 1.8rem; /* Make room for checkbox */
    padding-top: 0.2rem;
}

/* Bulk Action Toolbar */
.crystal-bulk-action-toolbar {
    display: none;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
    background: var(--background-modifier-hover);
    border: 1px solid var(--background-modifier-border);
    border-radius: 6px;
    padding: 0.75rem 1rem;
    margin-bottom: 1rem;
}
```

## Features Implemented

### 1. Selection System
- Checkbox appears in top-left corner of each card
- Click checkbox to select/deselect individual cards
- Visual feedback with accent color border when selected
- Selection state persists during view updates

### 2. Bulk Action Toolbar
- Appears automatically when cards are selected
- Shows count of selected cards
- Includes buttons for:
  - Select All - Select all cards across all columns
  - Clear - Clear all selections
  - Move - Move selected cards to another column
  - Tags - Add, remove, or replace tags on selected cards
  - Delete - Delete selected cards with confirmation

### 3. Bulk Operations

#### Delete Operation
- Confirmation modal shows exact count of cards to be deleted
- Async operation ensures modal closes properly after deletion
- Cards removed from all columns
- View refreshes automatically

#### Move Operation
- Visual column selector with actual column colors
- Cards moved from their current columns to target column
- Maintains card order and properties

#### Tag Management
- Three modes: Add tags, Remove tags, Replace all tags
- Comma-separated tag input
- Shows existing tags on selected cards as clickable chips
- Click existing tags to add them to input

### 4. Visual Design
- Clean checkbox design with simple filled rectangle when checked
- No complex graphics, just accent color fill
- Proper spacing to prevent text overlap
- Smooth transitions and hover effects
- Consistent with Obsidian's design language

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- Uses `Set<string>` for efficient selection tracking
- Selection state cleared after bulk operations
- Proper async/await for database operations

### Modal Implementation
- Custom modal classes extending Obsidian's Modal class
- Async callbacks for proper operation flow
- Modal closes automatically after operation completes

### CSS Considerations
- Fixed checkbox overlap issues by adding padding to card content
- Removed browser default checkbox styling completely
- Simple visual design without checkmarks (just filled rectangle)

## Issue Resolutions

1. **Checkbox Overlap**: Fixed by adding `padding-left: 1.8rem` to card content
2. **Checkbox Visual**: Simplified to filled rectangle instead of checkmark
3. **Modal Not Closing**: Fixed by making delete operation properly async
4. **Duplicate Methods**: Removed duplicate bulk action methods that were causing conflicts

## Testing Status
All bulk operations tested and working:
- ✅ Card selection/deselection
- ✅ Select all / Clear all
- ✅ Bulk delete with confirmation
- ✅ Bulk move to different columns
- ✅ Bulk tag management (add/remove/replace)
- ✅ Visual feedback and UI updates
- ✅ Modal interactions and auto-close

## Next Steps (if needed)
- Could add keyboard shortcuts for bulk operations
- Could add drag-select for multiple cards
- Could add bulk duplicate feature
- Could add export selected cards feature
